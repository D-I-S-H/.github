Dining Information Served Here (DISH) is a project that aims to give students a better way to access MTU's dining hall menus by retrieving and curating [dineoncampus](https://dineoncampus.com/) data.  

DISH is split up into two separate projects:
- [DISH API](https://github.com/D-I-S-H/DISH-API) - Backend which provides a REST API for the data
- [DISH Frontend](https://github.com/D-I-S-H/DISH-FE) - Frontend which provides a nice looking UI
